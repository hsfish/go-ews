Package `ews` is currently a work in progress.

> This package started as a fork of github.com/mhewedy/ews but has since then 
changed severely. Therefore it is not backwards compatible. See the UPGRADE 
guide for additional details.

```sh
go get github.com/Abovo-Media/go-ews
```

```go
import "github.com/Abovo-Media/go-ews"
```
